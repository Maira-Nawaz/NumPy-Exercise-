# NumPy-Exercise-


##  Overview

This repository contains comprehensive hands-on practice tasks for **NumPy (Numerical Python)**, a powerful Python library used extensively in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. These tasks were completed as part of the **Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp by Ai DataYard** to build foundational and advanced skills in working with numerical data using arrays and matrices.

##  Objectives

The goal of this module is to:

* Understand the basic and advanced functionalities of NumPy.
* Perform array creation, indexing, slicing, reshaping, and arithmetic operations.
* Work with 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays.
* Master broadcasting and boolean indexing.
* Learn to manipulate arrays for data transformation and analysis.

##  Contents

The module is organized into a series of tasks that focus on different aspects of NumPy:

| Task        | Description                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task 1**  | Introduction to NumPy arrays and creation from lists                 |
| **Task 2**  | Array indexing, slicing, and updating elements                       |
| **Task 3**  | Array shape, reshaping, and dimensionality                           |
| **Task 4**  | Mathematical operations on arrays (add, subtract, multiply, divide)  |
| **Task 5**  | Advanced slicing and copying behavior in arrays                      |
| **Task 6**  | Boolean indexing to filter arrays using conditions                   |
| **Task 7**  | Statistical operations like mean, median, std, min, max              |
| **Task 8**  | Random number generation and random sampling                         |
| **Task 9**  | Working with identity matrices and diagonal elements                 |
| **Task 10** | Broadcasting rules and operations between arrays of different shapes |
| **Task 11** | Practical exercises with 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays                       |
| **Task 12** | Sorting and searching operations in arrays                           |
| **Task 13** | Stacking and splitting arrays horizontally and vertically            |
| **Task 14** | Real-world style challenges and data manipulation exercises          |

Additionally:

* A dedicated section covers **Boolean Indexing**, a crucial technique for filtering and manipulating arrays using logical conditions.
* There is also a special focus on working with **multi-dimensional arrays** (1D, 2D, 3D), which is essential for data transformation and model input preparation in machine learning.

##  Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **NumPy**
* **Google Collab** or any Python-based IDE
